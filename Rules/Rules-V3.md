# The Comprehensive Rules of 28 (Kerala Style)

## 1. Introduction

"28" (Twenty-Eight / Irupathiyettu) or "Lelam" is a trick-taking card game originating from Kerala, South India. It is typically played by 3 or 4 players. The primary objective is to win tricks containing valuable cards to meet or exceed a contract ("bid") determined through two rounds of auction-style bidding per hand. A full game continues until one team (in 4-player mode) or one player (in 3-player mode) loses all their stakes. Key features include partnerships (in 4-player mode), a hidden trump suit determined by the final bidder and physically set aside, distinct rules and decks for 3 and 4 players, and specific procedures for leading tricks and revealing the trump.

## 2. Core Concepts

*   **Players:** Can be played with 3 or 4 players.
*   **Deck:**
    *   **4-Player Mode:** Uses a 32-card deck consisting of A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7 of each of the four standard suits (Spades ♠, Hearts ♥, Diamonds ♦, Clubs ♣).
    *   **3-Player Mode:** Uses a reduced 24-card deck consisting of A, K, Q, J, 10, 9 of each suit. **The 8s and 7s are removed from the deck.**
*   **Card Point Values:** (Applicable to cards present in the respective decks)
    *   **Jack (J):** 3 points
    *   **Nine (9):** 2 points
    *   **Ace (A):** 1 point
    *   **Ten (10):** 1 point
    *   **King (K), Queen (Q), Eight (8), Seven (7):** 0 points
    *   **Total Points in Deck:** 28 points (regardless of 3 or 4 player mode).
*   **Card Rank (Highest to Lowest within a suit):**
    *   **4-Player:** J > 9 > A > 10 > K > Q > 8 > 7
    *   **3-Player:** J > 9 > A > 10 > K > Q
*   **Card Secrecy:** Players must keep their cards hidden from other players at all times. No player should know which cards other players have except when cards are played or when the trump is revealed.
*   **Round Objective:** For each round of play, the objective for the bidding team (4p) or the lone bidder (3p) is to win tricks whose cumulative card point value is equal to or greater than their final contract bid. The opposing players aim to prevent this by capturing valuable point cards in their own tricks. Each round is scored independently based on whether this objective is met.
*   **Trump Suit:** One suit is designated as the "Trump" suit for each round by the final bidder.
    *   **Hidden Trump:** The trump suit is chosen secretly by the final bidder and is not announced initially. Until the trump suit is revealed, cards of the trump suit are treated exactly the same as any plain suit card with no special superiority.
    *   **Trump Superiority:** The trump suit becomes superior to all other suits ("plain suits") ONLY AFTER it has been revealed during play. Once revealed, any trump card beats any card of a plain suit.
    *   **Folded Trump Indicator:** The final bidder physically places one card of the chosen trump suit face-down, separate from their active hand, to lock in the choice. This card is revealed only under specific conditions during play.
*   **Trick:** A single round of play where each player plays one card.
    *   **Winning a Trick:** If the trump suit has been revealed, the trick is won by the player who played the highest-ranking trump card. If the trump suit has not been revealed or no trump cards were played in the trick, it is won by the player who played the highest-ranking card of the suit that was led.
*   **Partnerships & Alliances:**
    *   **4-Player:** Two fixed partnerships. Partners sit opposite each other in a square arrangement and combine their scores.
    *   **3-Player:** Players sit in a triangular arrangement and play individually. However, for the duration of the play phase of a round, the two players who did *not* win the final bid form a temporary alliance, playing against the lone Final Declarer. Their captured points are combined against the Declarer.
*   **Round:** A complete cycle of gameplay consisting of dealing, two bidding phases, playing all 8 tricks, and scoring. Each round has its own objective and is scored independently. A full game consists of multiple rounds.
*   **Original Starting Bidder:** The player seated immediately to the dealer's left. This position is important for leading the first trick.
*   **Stakes:** Units of money or points that players exchange after each round based on the outcome.
    *   **4-Player:** Each team starts with an agreed-upon amount of stakes. A full game continues until one team loses all their stakes.
    *   **3-Player:** Each player starts with an agreed-upon amount of stakes. A full game continues until one player loses all their stakes.

## 3. Game Setup

1.  **Choose Dealer:** For the very first round of a game, the dealer is chosen randomly (e.g., by high card draw or any other random method). For all subsequent rounds, the Original Starting Bidder from the previous round becomes the next dealer.
2.  **Select Deck:** Use the 32-card deck for 4 players or the 24-card deck for 3 players.
3.  **Shuffle:** The dealer shuffles the appropriate deck thoroughly.
4.  **Seating:**
    *   **4-Player Mode:** Partners sit opposite each other, forming a square arrangement.
    *   **3-Player Mode:** Players sit in a triangular arrangement, equidistant from each other.
5.  **Starting Stakes:** Before the first round, agree on a starting amount of money or coins to be used as stakes. This is essential as the game continues until one team or player loses all their stakes.
    *   **4-Player:** Each *team* starts with a fixed, shared pool of stakes (e.g., 20 units). Stakes are exchanged between the two teams.
    *   **3-Player:** Each *player* starts with their own fixed, individual amount of stakes (e.g., 20 units). Stakes are exchanged between the Declarer and each opponent individually.

## 4. Dealing Process (Two Batches)

The dealer deals cards clockwise in two distinct batches, with a bidding round after each. Players must keep their cards hidden from other players at all times - no player should know which cards other players have except when cards are played or when the trump is revealed:
1.  **First Batch:** Deal 4 cards to each player.
2.  **First Bidding Round:** Conduct the first auction (See Phase 1 below).
3.  **Second Batch:** Deal the remaining 4 cards to each player. Each player now holds their full hand of 8 cards (except the provisional bidder, who has 7 active + 1 folded).
4.  **Second Bidding Round:** Conduct the second and final auction (See Phase 2 below).

## 5. Gameplay Phases

### Phase 1: First Bidding Round & Provisional Trump Selection

1.  **Eligibility:** All players participate.
2.  **Starting Bidder:** The **Original Starting Bidder** (player to dealer's left) begins the auction. The Starting Bidder MUST make at least the minimum bid and cannot pass on their first turn.
3.  **Bidding:** Proceeds clockwise. Each player may:
    *   Make a numerical bid higher than the current highest bid. The minimum opening bid is 14 for 4-player mode and 12 for 3-player mode.
    *   Declare "Honors". An "Honors" bid in this round is any bid *exceeding* 18 (3-Player) or *exceeding* 20 (4-Player). This type of bid carries different scoring implications (see Section 6).
    *   Pass. A player who passes may still bid again later in the same round if the bidding continues and another player makes a higher bid. Bidding in Round 1 ends only when all players pass consecutively on the current highest bid.
4.  **Round 1 Winner (Bidder 1):** The player who makes the highest unchallenged bid (which could be a Normal bid or an Honors bid) in this round is referred to as "Bidder 1" throughout these rules. Let their bid be Bid 1.
    *   **Option to Concede:** After examining their initial 4 cards, Bidder 1 has the option to concede immediately if they feel they cannot make their bid. If they concede, they automatically lose the round, stakes are settled according to the scoring rules for a failed bid, and players proceed to the next round with a new dealer.
5.  **Provisional Trump Selection & Folding:**
    *   Bidder 1 examines their initial 4 cards.
    *   They secretly choose a provisional trump suit (Trump 1).
    *   They select **one card** from their hand belonging to the Trump 1 suit.
    *   They place this card **face-down** separately as the "folded trump indicator".
    *   Bidder 1 now holds 3 active cards and 1 folded card.

### Phase 2: Second Bidding Round & Final Trump Selection

1.  **Eligibility:** All players can participate in Round 2 bidding regardless of whether they passed in Round 1, as they now have new cards. As in Round 1, a player who passes may still bid again later if the bidding continues and another player makes a higher bid.
2.  **Starting Bidder:** The winner of the first bidding round (Bidder 1) starts the bidding in Round 2.
3.  **Minimum Bid:**
    *   **4-Player:** 24
    *   **3-Player:** 22
    *   If Bid 1 (from Round 1) is less than these minimums, bidding *must* start at 24/22 or higher.
    *   If Bid 1 is already equal to or greater than these minimums, bidding *must* start higher than Bid 1.
4.  **Bidding:** Proceeds clockwise. Players can bid higher than the current highest bid (from either round), declare Honors, or pass. Bidding in Round 2 ends only when all players pass consecutively on the current highest bid, just as in Round 1.
5.  **Determining Final Declarer & Final Trump:**
    *   The player with the highest unchallenged bid across both rounds (or the final Honors declaration) is the **Final Declarer**. Their bid is the **Final Contract**.
    *   **Option to Concede:** After examining their full hand, the Final Declarer has the option to concede immediately if they feel they cannot make their bid. If they concede, they automatically lose the round, stakes are settled according to the scoring rules for a failed bid, and players proceed to the next round with a new dealer.
    *   **Case 1: Final Declarer is DIFFERENT from Bidder 1:**
        *   Bidder 1 picks up their originally folded card, returning it to their active hand (now holds 8 cards).
        *   The Final Declarer (now Bidder 2) examines their full 8-card hand.
        *   They secretly choose the final trump suit (Trump 2).
        *   They select one card of the Trump 2 suit and fold it face-down.
        *   The Final Declarer proceeds with 7 active cards. The Final Trump is Trump 2.
    *   **Case 2: Final Declarer is THE SAME as Bidder 1:**
        *   The Final Declarer (Bidder 1) examines their full hand (7 active + 1 folded).
        *   They choose one of the following:
            *   **Option A (Keep Trump 1):** Do nothing; the originally folded card remains the indicator. Proceed with 7 active cards. Final Trump is Trump 1.
            *   **Option B (Choose New Trump 2):** Pick up the originally folded card (return to active hand, now 8 cards). Choose a *new* trump suit (Trump 2). Select one card of this Trump 2 suit and fold it face-down. Proceed with 7 active cards. Final Trump is Trump 2.
    *   The suit of the card currently folded by the Final Declarer represents the **Final Trump Suit**, which remains secret.

### Phase 3: Playing the Tricks (8 Tricks Total)

1.  **Leading the First Trick:** The **Original Starting Bidder** (player to dealer's left) **always leads the first trick**, regardless of who the Final Declarer is. They play from their active hand (8 cards, unless they are the Declarer, then 7).
2.  **Leading Restrictions:** The Declarer CANNOT lead a trick with a card of the trump suit if the trump has not yet been revealed. The Declarer must lead with a card of a different suit until the trump is revealed.
3.  **Following Suit:** Play proceeds clockwise. Players must play a card of the suit led, if they possess one ("follow suit").
    *   **Strategic Exception for Declarer:** If a non-declarer leads with a card of the trump suit (without knowing it's trump since it hasn't been revealed yet), and the declarer has only the folded card of that suit, the declarer has a special exemption from the "follow suit" rule. The declarer can choose to play any other card from their hand, not reveal that the led suit is actually the trump suit, and keep the folded card hidden. This is a strategic move that allows the declarer to protect their trump card and maintain the secrecy of the trump suit.
4.  **Unable to Follow Suit & Trump Reveal:**
    *   **If a Non-Declarer Cannot Follow Suit:** Before playing, they may ask the Final Declarer, "Trump?".
        *   **Declarer's Response:** The Final Declarer *must* turn their folded trump indicator card face-up, revealing the Final Trump suit to all. The Declarer then picks up this revealed card and adds it to their active hand (now holding 8 cards).
        *   **Asker's Play (Crucial Rule):** After the trump is revealed *due to their request*, the asking player **must** play a card of the trump suit if they possess one during that specific trick. If they do not possess any trump cards, they may discard any other card.
        *   A non-declarer unable to follow suit may choose to play any card (from any suit) without asking for trump, leaving the trump hidden. Asking for trump is a choice, not mandatory.
    *   **If the Final Declarer Cannot Follow Suit:**
        *   The Declarer has two options:
            *   **Option 1: Play Trump (Ruff):** Play a card from the Final Trump suit (if they hold one in their active hand or if the folded card is their only trump).
                *   **Crucially, playing a trump card in this situation *does not* automatically reveal the Final Trump suit.**
                *   **Important:** If the trump suit is not revealed, the played trump card is treated exactly like a normal suit card with no special superiority. It will not win the trick unless it is the highest card of the suit led.
                *   The Declarer is ONLY allowed to reveal the trump suit in this situation - when they cannot follow the lead suit. The Declarer cannot reveal trump at any other time except when asked by another player who cannot follow suit.
                *   If the Declarer wishes to reveal the trump suit at this time, they must make an explicit declaration (e.g., placing the folded card face-up).
                *   **Important:** If the Declarer reveals the trump suit during a trick, they MUST play the revealed (folded) card for that specific trick. They are not allowed to play other cards from the trump suit or any other card from a different suit for that specific trick.
                *   Only after the trump suit is formally revealed does it gain superiority over other suits.
                *   After revealing the trump and playing the folded card, the Declarer will have no more folded cards for future tricks.
            *   **Option 2: Discard:** Play any card from a different plain suit. This does not reveal the trump suit.
4.  **Playing Trump (Once Revealed - General Rule):** Once the Final Trump suit is known (either by being asked by an opponent or explicitly revealed by the Declarer):
    *   If trump is led, players must follow with trump if possible.
    *   If a plain suit is led, players must follow that suit. If unable, they **may** play trump ("ruff") or discard another plain suit card. *(Note: This general rule differs from the specific rule above for the player who just asked for the reveal).*
    *   **Special Case: Only Trump Cards Remain:** If a player cannot follow the suit led, and **all** the cards remaining in their hand belong to the trump suit, they **must** play a trump card.
        *   This forced play of a trump card **does not**, by itself, reveal the trump suit if it was previously unrevealed.
        *   If the player is the Declarer, they still retain the option to explicitly reveal the trump suit using the designated action when making this forced trump play (unless it's their absolute last card and it's the folded one).
    *   **Declarer's Option to Reveal:** The Declarer may choose to explicitly reveal the (previously unrevealed) Final Trump suit ONLY when they cannot follow the lead suit or when asked by another player who cannot follow suit. The Declarer CANNOT reveal trump at any other time. If the Declarer reveals the trump suit during a trick, they MUST play the revealed (folded) card for that specific trick, not any other card.
5.  **Winning a Trick:** The highest trump card played wins the trick *if the trump suit has been revealed*. If no trump cards are played, or if the trump suit is not revealed, the highest card of the suit led wins.
6.  **Collecting Tricks:** The winner of the trick collects the cards played (3 or 4 cards) and places them face-down.
7.  **Leading Subsequent Tricks (Tricks 2-8):** The **winner of the previous trick** leads the next trick.
8.  **Conceding the Round:** If the Final Declarer believes they cannot win enough points to meet their bid, they may concede the round. This option is available at any point during the game to the bid winner - immediately after winning the bid in Phase 1, after winning the final bid in Phase 2, or during trick play (as long as they have not yet won enough points to meet their bid). When conceding:
    *   The Declarer announces their concession.
    *   Play immediately stops.
    *   The round is automatically scored as a failed bid:
        *   **4-Player Mode:** The Declarer's entire team loses the round.
        *   **3-Player Mode:** The individual Declarer loses the round.
    *   Stakes are settled according to the scoring rules for a failed bid.
    *   Players proceed to the next round with a new dealer.

## 6. Scoring

1.  **Determine Round Outcome:**
    *   **If the Declarer Conceded:** The round is automatically scored as a failed bid. No point counting is necessary, as concession results in an automatic loss. Note that concession is only possible when the Declarer has not yet won enough points to meet their bid.
        *   **4-Player Mode:** The Declarer's entire team loses the round.
        *   **3-Player Mode:** The individual Declarer loses the round.
    *   **If All Tricks Were Played:**
        *   **Count Card Points:** Each side (Declarer's team/side vs. Defenders' team/side) sums the point values (J=3, 9=2, A=1, 10=1) of the cards in the tricks they won.
        *   **Compare Points to Bid:** Compare the Final Declarer's side's total points against the Final Contract bid.
            *   **Bid Made:** Declarer's points >= Final Contract.
            *   **Bid Failed:** Declarer's points < Final Contract.
2.  **Award Game Points & Settle Stakes (Confirm House Rules):** Accumulate Game Points and exchange stakes based on the round outcome.
    *   **If Final Bid was from Round 1:**
        *   **Normal Bid (<=18 for 3p / <=20 for 4p):**
            *   Bid Made: +1 Game Point for Declarer('s side).
                *   4p: Winning team collects 1 unit of stake from the losing team.
                *   3p: Declarer collects 1 unit of stake *from each* opponent.
            *   Bid Failed: -1 Game Point for Declarer('s side).
                *   4p: Declarer's team pays 1 unit of stake to the winning team.
                *   3p: Declarer pays 1 unit of stake *to each* opponent.
        *   **Honors Bid (>18 for 3p / >20 for 4p):**
            *   Bid Made: +2 Game Points for Declarer('s side).
                *   4p: Winning team collects 2 units of stake from the losing team.
                *   3p: Declarer collects 2 units of stake *from each* opponent.
            *   Bid Failed: -2 Game Points for Declarer('s side).
                *   4p: Declarer's team pays 2 units of stake to the winning team.
                *   3p: Declarer pays 2 units of stake *to each* opponent.
    *   **If Final Bid was from Round 2 (Minimum Bid 24/22):**
        *   **4-Player Mode (Min Bid 24):**
            *   Bid Made: +2 Game Points for Declarer's team. Winning team collects 2 units of stake from the losing team's shared pool.
            *   Bid Failed: -3 Game Points for Declarer's team. Declarer's team pays 3 units of stake from their shared pool to the winning team.
        *   **3-Player Mode (Min Bid 22):**
            *   Bid Made: +2 Game Points for Declarer. Declarer collects 2 units of stake *from each* opponent individually (total 4 units received).
            *   Bid Failed: -4 Game Points for Declarer. Declarer pays 2 units of stake *to each* opponent individually (total 4 units paid).

## 7. Winning the Game

### Definition of a Full Game
A full game continues until one team (in 4-player mode) or one player (in 3-player mode) loses all their money/stakes. The game consists of multiple rounds, with stakes being exchanged after each round according to the scoring rules.

### Game Progression
1. **Starting Stakes:** Before the game begins, each team (4p) or individual player (3p) starts with an agreed-upon amount of money or stakes.
2. **Round Completion:** After each round, stakes are exchanged based on the outcome as described in the Scoring section.
3. **Elimination:** When a team or player loses all their money, they are eliminated, and the game ends.
4. **Winner:** The team(s) or player(s) with remaining money at the end are the winners.

### Alternative Winning Conditions (Optional)
As an alternative to playing until elimination, players may agree beforehand to:
- Play until a predetermined target number of Game Points (e.g., 6, 8, 10, 12) is reached
- Play a fixed number of rounds
- Play for a set amount of time

In these cases, the final settlement of stakes occurs at the end based on the difference in accumulated stakes or overall Game Points, as agreed beforehand.

## 8. Key Rule Summary & Unique Aspects

*   **Deck Differences:** 32 cards (A-7) for 4 players, 24 cards (A-9) for 3 players.
*   **Card Secrecy:** Players must keep their cards hidden from other players at all times. No player should know which cards other players have except when cards are played or when the trump is revealed.
*   **Two Bidding Rounds:** An initial round after 4 cards, a second round after 8 cards with higher minimums. The winner of the first bidding round (Bidder 1) starts the bidding in Round 2.
*   **Two-Stage Trump Selection:** Provisional trump chosen after Round 1, final trump chosen after Round 2 (with option for Bidder 1=Bidder 2 to revise).
*   **Folded Trump Indicator:** Physical card set aside face-down to lock in the secret trump choice.
*   **Hidden Trump Reveal:** Trump suit is only revealed when requested by a player unable to follow suit, or when the Declarer cannot follow the lead suit. The Declarer can ONLY reveal trump when they cannot follow the lead suit or when asked by another player who cannot follow suit. Asking for trump is optional - a non-declarer unable to follow suit may choose to play any card without asking. Until revealed, trump cards have no special superiority and are treated as plain suit cards. Even if the Declarer plays a trump card without revealing it, that card is treated as a normal suit card with no special superiority. If the Declarer reveals the trump suit during a trick, they MUST play the revealed (folded) card for that specific trick.
*   **Trump Leading Restriction:** The Declarer CANNOT lead a trick with a card of the trump suit if the trump has not yet been revealed.
*   **Strategic Exception to Following Suit:** If a non-declarer leads with a card of the trump suit (without knowing it's trump since it hasn't been revealed yet), and the declarer has only the folded card of that suit, the declarer can choose to play any other card instead of following suit. This allows the declarer to protect their trump card and maintain the secrecy of the trump suit.
*   **Original Bidder Leads:** The player to the dealer's left *always* leads the first trick.
*   **Dealer Rotation:** After each round, the Original Starting Bidder becomes the dealer for the next round.
*   **Tiered Scoring:** Game points awarded/lost depend on whether the final bid was made in Round 1 or Round 2 (or was Honors).
*   **Concession Option:** The bid winner may concede if they believe they cannot make their bid. This option is available at any point - immediately after winning the bid in Phase 1, after winning the final bid in Phase 2, or during trick play (as long as they have not yet won enough points to meet their bid). Concession results in an automatic loss - the entire team loses in 4-player mode, and the individual Declarer loses in 3-player mode.
*   **Full Game Definition:** A full game continues until one team (4p) or player (3p) loses all their stakes.
*   **Follow Suit:** To play a card of the same suit as the card led to the trick.
*   **Honors:** A bid made during the first bidding round that *exceeds* 18 (3-Player) or *exceeds* 20 (4-Player), carrying specific scoring implications if it becomes the final contract.
*   **Lead:** To play the first card to a trick.

## 9. Glossary

*   **Bid:** A declaration during the auction phase to win a certain number of card points.
*   **Bidder 1:** The player who makes the highest unchallenged bid in the first bidding round. This player selects the provisional trump suit and folds one card of that suit as the trump indicator.
*   **Concede:** A decision by the bid winner to surrender the round when they believe they cannot make their bid. This option is available at any point - immediately after winning the bid in Phase 1, after winning the final bid in Phase 2, or during trick play (as long as they have not yet won enough points to meet their bid). When a bid winner concedes, the round is automatically lost:
    *   **4-Player Mode:** The Declarer's entire team loses the round.
    *   **3-Player Mode:** The individual Declarer loses the round.
    The bid is considered failed, stakes are settled accordingly, and players proceed to the next round.
*   **Contract:** The final, highest bid made in a round, which the Declarer must achieve.
*   **Dealer:** The player responsible for shuffling and dealing the cards for a round. For the very first round of a game, the dealer is chosen randomly (e.g., by high card draw). For all subsequent rounds, the Original Starting Bidder from the previous round becomes the dealer.
*   **Declarer:** The player who makes the final, highest bid (the Final Declarer).
*   **Defender:** Any player who is not the Declarer (in 3p) or not on the Declarer's team (in 4p).
*   **Folded Trump Indicator:** The single card placed face-down by the Declarer representing the secret trump suit.
*   **Follow Suit:** To play a card of the same suit as the card led to the trick.
*   **Full Game:** A complete game that continues until one team (in 4-player mode) or one player (in 3-player mode) loses all their stakes.
*   **Honors:** A bid made during the first bidding round that *exceeds* 18 (3-Player) or *exceeds* 20 (4-Player), carrying specific scoring implications if it becomes the final contract.
*   **Lead:** To play the first card to a trick.
*   **Original Starting Bidder:** The player to the dealer's left, who starts the bidding and leads the first trick. This player becomes the dealer for the next round.
*   **Plain Suit:** Any suit that is not the trump suit.
*   **Round:** A complete cycle of gameplay for one deal, consisting of dealing, two bidding phases, playing all 8 tricks, and scoring for that deal.
*   **Ruff / Trump (verb):** To play a trump card on a trick when a plain suit was led and the player cannot follow suit.
*   **Stakes:** The units of money or points that players exchange based on the outcome of each round. A full game continues until one team or player loses all their stakes.
*   **Trick:** One instance of play where each player plays a single card. A full round consists of 8 tricks.
*   **Trump Suit:** The suit chosen by the Declarer. Once revealed, it outranks all other suits for the round. Until revealed, cards of the trump suit have no special superiority and are treated exactly the same as any plain suit card.
