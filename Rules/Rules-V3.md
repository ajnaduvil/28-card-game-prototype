# The Comprehensive Rules of 28 (Kerala Style)

## 1. Introduction

"28" (Twenty-Eight / Irupathiyettu) or "Lelam" is a trick-taking card game originating from Kerala, South India. It is typically played by 3 or 4 players. The primary objective is to win tricks containing valuable cards to meet or exceed a contract ("bid") determined through two rounds of auction-style bidding per hand. Key features include partnerships (in 4-player mode), a hidden trump suit determined by the final bidder and physically set aside, distinct rules and decks for 3 and 4 players, and specific procedures for leading tricks and revealing the trump.

## 2. Core Concepts

*   **Players:** Can be played with 3 or 4 players.
*   **Deck:**
    *   **4-Player Mode:** Uses a 32-card deck consisting of A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7 of each of the four standard suits (Spades ♠, Hearts ♥, Diamonds ♦, Clubs ♣).
    *   **3-Player Mode:** Uses a reduced 24-card deck consisting of A, K, Q, J, 10, 9 of each suit. **The 8s and 7s are removed from the deck.**
*   **Card Point Values:** (Applicable to cards present in the respective decks)
    *   **Jack (J):** 3 points
    *   **Nine (9):** 2 points
    *   **Ace (A):** 1 point
    *   **Ten (10):** 1 point
    *   **King (K), Queen (Q), Eight (8), Seven (7):** 0 points
    *   **Total Points in Deck:** 28 points (regardless of 3 or 4 player mode).
*   **Card Rank (Highest to Lowest within a suit):**
    *   **4-Player:** J > 9 > A > 10 > K > Q > 8 > 7
    *   **3-Player:** J > 9 > A > 10 > K > Q
*   **Objective:** For the bidding team (4p) or the lone bidder (3p) to win tricks whose cumulative card point value is equal to or greater than their final contract bid. The opposing players aim to prevent this.
*   **Trump Suit:** One suit is designated as the "Trump" suit for each round by the final bidder. This suit is superior to all other suits ("plain suits").
    *   **Hidden Trump:** The trump suit is chosen secretly by the final bidder and is not announced initially.
    *   **Folded Trump Indicator:** The final bidder physically places one card of the chosen trump suit face-down, separate from their active hand, to lock in the choice. This card is revealed only under specific conditions during play.
*   **Trick:** A single round of play where each player plays one card.
    *   **Winning a Trick:** The trick is won by the player who played the highest-ranking trump card. If no trump cards were played in the trick, it is won by the player who played the highest-ranking card of the suit that was led.
*   **Partnerships & Alliances:**
    *   **4-Player:** Two fixed partnerships. Partners sit opposite each other and combine their scores.
    *   **3-Player:** Players play individually. However, for the duration of the play phase of a round, the two players who did *not* win the final bid form a temporary alliance, playing against the lone Final Declarer. Their captured points are combined against the Declarer.
*   **Original Starting Bidder:** The player seated immediately to the dealer's right. This position is important for leading the first trick.

## 3. Game Setup

1.  **Choose Dealer:** Randomly for the first round (e.g., high card draw). The deal rotates clockwise for subsequent rounds.
2.  **Select Deck:** Use the 32-card deck for 4 players or the 24-card deck for 3 players.
3.  **Shuffle:** The dealer shuffles the appropriate deck thoroughly.
4.  **Seating:** In 4-player mode, partners sit opposite each other.
5.  **(Optional) Starting Stakes:** Before the first round, agree on a starting amount of money or coins.
    *   **4-Player:** Each team starts with a fixed, equal amount.
    *   **3-Player:** Each player starts with a fixed, equal amount.

## 4. Dealing Process (Two Batches)

The dealer deals cards clockwise in two distinct batches, with a bidding round after each:
1.  **First Batch:** Deal 4 cards to each player.
2.  **First Bidding Round:** Conduct the first auction (See Phase 1 below).
3.  **Second Batch:** Deal the remaining 4 cards to each player. Each player now holds their full hand of 8 cards (except the provisional bidder, who has 7 active + 1 folded).
4.  **Second Bidding Round:** Conduct the second and final auction (See Phase 2 below).

## 5. Gameplay Phases

### Phase 1: First Bidding Round & Provisional Trump Selection

1.  **Eligibility:** All players participate.
2.  **Starting Bidder:** The **Original Starting Bidder** (player to dealer's right) begins the auction.
3.  **Bidding:** Proceeds clockwise. Each player may:
    *   Make a numerical bid higher than the current highest bid. The minimum opening bid is typically 14 (confirm with players).
    *   Declare "Honors". An "Honors" bid in this round is any bid *exceeding* 18 (3-Player) or *exceeding* 20 (4-Player). This type of bid carries different scoring implications (see Section 6).
    *   Pass. Passing in this round only prevents further bidding *within this first round*.
4.  **Round 1 Winner (Bidder 1):** The player who makes the highest unchallenged bid (which could be a Normal bid or an Honors bid) in this round. Let their bid be Bid 1.
5.  **Provisional Trump Selection & Folding:**
    *   Bidder 1 examines their initial 4 cards.
    *   They secretly choose a provisional trump suit (Trump 1).
    *   They select **one card** from their hand belonging to the Trump 1 suit.
    *   They place this card **face-down** separately as the "folded trump indicator".
    *   Bidder 1 now holds 3 active cards and 1 folded card.

### Phase 2: Second Bidding Round & Final Trump Selection

1.  **Eligibility:** Players who did not pass in Round 1 can continue. Players who passed in Round 1 *can* re-enter bidding in Round 2 if they wish, unless they pass again.
2.  **Starting Bidder:** Bidding can continue clockwise from where Round 1 ended, **or** Bidder 1 (the winner of the first round) may choose to start the bidding in Round 2. Confirm the convention before starting.
3.  **Minimum Bid:**
    *   **4-Player:** 24
    *   **3-Player:** 22
    *   If Bid 1 (from Round 1) is less than these minimums, bidding *must* start at 24/22 or higher.
    *   If Bid 1 is already equal to or greater than these minimums, bidding *must* start higher than Bid 1.
4.  **Bidding:** Proceeds clockwise. Players can bid higher than the current highest bid (from either round), declare Honors, or pass. Passing now is permanent for the entire round.
5.  **Determining Final Declarer & Final Trump:**
    *   The player with the highest unchallenged bid across both rounds (or the final Honors declaration) is the **Final Declarer**. Their bid is the **Final Contract**.
    *   **Case 1: Final Declarer is DIFFERENT from Bidder 1:**
        *   Bidder 1 picks up their originally folded card, returning it to their active hand (now holds 8 cards).
        *   The Final Declarer (now Bidder 2) examines their full 8-card hand.
        *   They secretly choose the final trump suit (Trump 2).
        *   They select one card of the Trump 2 suit and fold it face-down.
        *   The Final Declarer proceeds with 7 active cards. The Final Trump is Trump 2.
    *   **Case 2: Final Declarer is THE SAME as Bidder 1:**
        *   The Final Declarer (Bidder 1) examines their full hand (7 active + 1 folded).
        *   They choose one of the following:
            *   **Option A (Keep Trump 1):** Do nothing; the originally folded card remains the indicator. Proceed with 7 active cards. Final Trump is Trump 1.
            *   **Option B (Choose New Trump 2):** Pick up the originally folded card (return to active hand, now 8 cards). Choose a *new* trump suit (Trump 2). Select one card of this Trump 2 suit and fold it face-down. Proceed with 7 active cards. Final Trump is Trump 2.
    *   The suit of the card currently folded by the Final Declarer represents the **Final Trump Suit**, which remains secret.

### Phase 3: Playing the Tricks (8 Tricks Total)

1.  **Leading the First Trick:** The **Original Starting Bidder** (player to dealer's right) **always leads the first trick**, regardless of who the Final Declarer is. They play from their active hand (8 cards, unless they are the Declarer, then 7).
2.  **Following Suit:** Play proceeds clockwise. Players must play a card of the suit led, if they possess one ("follow suit").
3.  **Unable to Follow Suit & Trump Reveal:**
    *   **If a Non-Declarer Cannot Follow Suit:** Before playing, they may ask the Final Declarer, "Trump?".
        *   **Declarer's Response:** The Final Declarer *must* turn their folded trump indicator card face-up, revealing the Final Trump suit to all. The Declarer then picks up this revealed card and adds it to their active hand (now holding 8 cards). The asking player then makes their play (trumping if possible and desired, or discarding).
        *   Alternatively (less common), a non-declarer unable to follow suit *could* play a card without asking, leaving the trump hidden.
    *   **If the Final Declarer Cannot Follow Suit:**
        *   **If they hold other cards of the Final Trump suit in their active hand:** They *must* play one of these trump cards. The Declarer may choose whether or not to *also* formally reveal the trump suit by turning over the folded indicator card at this point. If they *do* choose to turn over the indicator card, they must pick it up and add it to their active hand. If they choose *not* to turn over the indicator, the trump suit remains technically unrevealed (until asked or forced later), and the played card functions as a normal card since the trump is not revealed.
        *   **If their only card of the Final Trump suit is the folded one:** They *must* turn over the folded card (revealing the trump suit) and play it if it's a legal play for the trick. This card functions as trump. They add it back to their active hand after the trick if it wasn't played.
4.  **Playing Trump (Once Revealed):** Once the Final Trump suit is known:
    *   If trump is led, players must follow with trump if possible.
    *   If a plain suit is led, players must follow that suit. If unable, they may play trump ("ruff") or discard another plain suit card.
5.  **Winning a Trick:** The highest trump card played wins the trick. If no trump cards are played, the highest card of the suit led wins.
6.  **Collecting Tricks:** The winner of the trick collects the cards played (3 or 4 cards) and places them face-down.
7.  **Leading Subsequent Tricks (Tricks 2-8):** The **winner of the previous trick** leads the next trick.

## 6. Scoring

1.  **Count Card Points:** After all 8 tricks are played, each side (Declarer's team/side vs. Defenders' team/side) sums the point values (J=3, 9=2, A=1, 10=1) of the cards in the tricks they won.
2.  **Determine Round Outcome:** Compare the Final Declarer's side's total points against the Final Contract bid.
    *   **Bid Made:** Declarer's points >= Final Contract.
    *   **Bid Failed:** Declarer's points < Final Contract.
3.  **Award Game Points & Settle Stakes (Confirm House Rules):** Accumulate Game Points and exchange stakes based on the round outcome.
    *   **If Final Bid was from Round 1:**
        *   **Normal Bid (<=18 for 3p / <=20 for 4p):**
            *   Bid Made: +1 Game Point for Declarer('s side). Winning side collects 1 unit of stake from the losing side (or each losing player in 3p).
            *   Bid Failed: -1 Game Point for Declarer('s side). Declarer('s side) pays 1 unit of stake to the winning side (or each winning player in 3p).
        *   **Honors Bid (>18 for 3p / >20 for 4p):**
            *   Bid Made: +2 Game Points for Declarer('s side). Winning side collects 2 units of stake from the losing side (or each losing player in 3p).
            *   Bid Failed: -2 Game Points for Declarer('s side). Declarer('s side) pays 2 units of stake to the winning side (or each winning player in 3p).
    *   **If Final Bid was from Round 2 (Minimum Bid 24/22):**
        *   **4-Player Mode (Min Bid 24):**
            *   Bid Made: +2 Game Points for Declarer's team. Winning team collects 2 units of stake from the losing team.
            *   Bid Failed: -3 Game Points for Declarer's team. Losing team pays 3 units of stake to the winning team.
        *   **3-Player Mode (Min Bid 22):**
            *   Bid Made: +2 Game Points for Declarer. Declarer collects 2 units of stake *from each* opponent (total 4 units).
            *   Bid Failed: -4 Game Points for Declarer. Declarer pays 2 units of stake *to each* opponent (total 4 units).
    *   **"Coat" / "Kap" (Optional):** If the Declarer fails the bid by a large margin or scores very few points (define specific conditions), the Game Points lost/gained and the stakes exchanged may be doubled.

## 7. Winning the Game

The game continues over multiple rounds. The first team (4p) or potentially individual (3p) to reach a predetermined target number of Game Points (e.g., 6, 8, 10, 12) wins the overall game. The final settlement of stakes occurs at the end of the game based on the difference in accumulated stakes or overall Game Points, as agreed beforehand.

## 8. Key Rule Summary & Unique Aspects

*   **Deck Differences:** 32 cards (A-7) for 4 players, 24 cards (A-9) for 3 players.
*   **Two Bidding Rounds:** An initial round after 4 cards, a second round after 8 cards with higher minimums.
*   **Two-Stage Trump Selection:** Provisional trump chosen after Round 1, final trump chosen after Round 2 (with option for Bidder 1=Bidder 2 to revise).
*   **Folded Trump Indicator:** Physical card set aside face-down to lock in the secret trump choice.
*   **Hidden Trump Reveal:** Trump suit is only revealed when requested by a player unable to follow suit, or when the Declarer is forced to play or declare it.
*   **Original Bidder Leads:** The player to the dealer's right *always* leads the first trick.
*   **Tiered Scoring:** Game points awarded/lost depend on whether the final bid was made in Round 1 or Round 2 (or was Honors).
*   **Follow Suit:** To play a card of the same suit as the card led to the trick.
*   **Honors:** A bid made during the first bidding round that *exceeds* 18 (3-Player) or *exceeds* 20 (4-Player), carrying specific scoring implications if it becomes the final contract.
